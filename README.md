# SQL Business Case Studies

SQL portfolio project with practical business questions covering sales, customers, marketing, finance, and operations.

## Business Questions

- How can SQL answer recurring business questions?
- Which metrics require grouping and ranking?
- How should query outputs be explained?
- What reusable query patterns matter for analysts?

## Repository Structure

```text
data/                 Sample data for the case study
src/                  Python analysis workflow
sql/                  SQL queries for KPI extraction
reports/              Executive summary and recommendations
outputs/              Generated analysis outputs, ignored by git
requirements.txt      Python dependencies
```

## How To Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/analysis.py
```

The script reads `data/sample_data.csv`, creates KPI summaries, and saves generated outputs in `outputs/`.
